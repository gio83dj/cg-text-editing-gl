# cg-text-editing
 
A node that gives you a time to edit a string before it passes it on.

Set the timeout, plug the input string in.

When the node excutes you can edit the string, press 'shift-enter' to submit it.

If you reach the timeout, whatever you have gets sent.

That's it.

Clone the repository inside the `custom_nodes` folder of your ComfyUI installation:

```bash
